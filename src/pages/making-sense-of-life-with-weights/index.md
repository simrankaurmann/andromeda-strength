The hardships, gains, injuries, pressure, and persistence.

What does it mean to go the gym, to exert your self, to do things as seemingly pointless as .. ?

Why then, if it is so pointless, gym life is so precious, the gains derived from it so valued? We place it in such high regards in society. The men with big muscles drive up their attractiveness and appeal to the opposite gender, all the while driving up respect amongst their peer males. The same goes for women in slightly different ways.

There is no direct causal relation to why we do it. It doesn't directly make us more money, or give us immediate pleasure.

Why do we then put ourselves through the pains, and hardships?

Status is more intangible both in terms of the actions require to obtain it and also the benefits derived from it. That's the science behind it. The technical reason why we do it.

But it doesn't explain why we get motivated in the first place, when there has not been the necessary amount of success gained from the gym to create the effects of positive reinforcement. In other words when you are a beginner what is it that motivates you to keep going to the gym?

It's the challenge of the weight, the resistance yo feel on every inch of your body. When it takes over your entire brain and requires your entire focus to push or pull that weight.

It's about subjecting yourself to the full to the rigorous regiment you have put in front of yourself. You know it has to be done, the task ahead of yourself.

Most people cannot put themselves through this. That is the reason you don't see every other person in the street with an impressive physique or superhuman strength.

Only a few people who may be pre-determined via their upbringing achieve this level of drive to push themselves through the mountain in front of them despite not seeing any good enough reason to do it.

This kind of person has the determination to fight when there is nothing going right in his or her world. Nothing seems to be in the correct place. There seems to be no way out, yet this person can create a way out. This person can fight when all seems hopeless. He is the light in a very dark tunnel, because he has the courage to accept the truth. He is immensely strong before he has even begun moving the mountain in front of him.

Question is, when cornered will you fight or will you succumb. Will you change or will you stay the same. Will you stand or fall. Every weight in front of you, every challenge in front of you is a question - a question of what will you do next? The will to keep fighting even when it is to no avail. Not getting discouraged by the fruits of his labour.

Man has to find himself to constantly decide if in the next moment he will do the right thing for himself and others or will he do that which is false. If he doesnt find this will himself to ask this question to himself he may be living in denial, in falsehood, distracted by temptations.

Take on this challenge everyday and you should soon see the fruits of positive reinforcement kicking in to help you subconsciously. As the say, fortune favours the brave....
