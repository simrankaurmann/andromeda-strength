Do you want to have more energy? 

Do you want to get rid of tiredness instantly?

High energy can revitalise our experience of life. Energy gives us an aliveness and a full extension of life. It lends us the capabilities to take on our day and deal with a situation to the best of our abilities.

This is even more important as you start to age. Think about how different it was for you to go on a night out when you were 19 vs when you are 25. 

Do you want high energy even as you turn 60? There are only 2 steps to increase your energy levels.

The key to optimum performance would be to keep yourself at the best energy level, with long-term consistency. You don’t want to give it your all for one week and then fall flat the week afterwards.

We are all different in many ways, so to understand your relationship with energy you need to recognise, observe and learn to understand what energy means for you specifically. 

Then, it's time to take action to implement changes in our daily life with Step 2.

## Step 1 Recognise

Energy is not the easiest to recognise, but you can notice it from time to time. Sometimes you may feel low on energy, whilst feeling motivated on another day.

A whole slew of factors can affect our energies. It will be critical for us to notice what days we have high energy and on what days we have low energies.


Certain activities can also affect our energy. to learn and recognise our strong and weak points, observe your energies in the following activities:

| Activities        | Environments          | Internal factors  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Exercising     | Weather | Stress |
| Watching a movie/TV series | Social Surrounding | Phsyical health|
| Browsing social media | Economic/social/political | Diet|
| Listening to music | Time of day  | Mental Health |

Next time you find yourself in the above situations, notice your energy levels. Notice how you feel. 

> Are you feeling sharp, energised, and ready to act or taken back, slow, and disinterested? 

A good tip I can give you is to start a journal. It will help you recall what each of the above situations mean for your energy levels. It also acts as a reminder to be aware of energy.

Now that you have awareness, it's time to act.

## Step 2 Action

Once you notice your energy patterns, over time, you will receive clues on the activities or environments to avoid or do more of.

Here are the same activities that we were journaling and noting our energy levels. In *Italics* is what I’ve noticed about my energy levels when doing and after doing these simple activities.

| Acitivity       | Impact on Energy       |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| Watching a TV series| _Not much difference noted during and after watching a TV series_ |
| Listening to music     | _High energy when listening to music and even higher when listening to hip hop_  |  
| Browsing social edia| _Very low energy no motivation to do anything_     |  
| Social surroundings| _I feel energised and want to push myself when I’m training with a group of friends_|  

From the above, I can now say that listening to music the most energy-enhancing activity for me. When I need to call on my energy (say when doing a heavy set or if I’m feeling sluggish in the afternoon before workout time), I now know that I can utilise music. 

To take this observation a step further, I know hip hop music has a track record of getting me hyped up.

By the same token, I should avoid social media when I want to sustain my energy. This is because my observation shows I am not motivated when using social media. 

And finally, I want to take my friends to the gym with me as I want to progress and lift heavier today.

It is also good to try something new that you don’t have any experience with, it can give you newfound energy.

> It may or may not be a resourceful change, but experimentation leads you to progress. You cannot keep relying on the well-trialled methods to give you new results. 

Here are some recent ideas that I have picked up from time to time and how they have benefited my energy levels.
- new music genre, gym mixes, and cinematic music
- high energy food in diet–dark chocolate and green tea provide a steady release of energy
- exercise–yoga, a reduction in distractions, and sustained increase in energy throughout the day.

Progression in your weightlifting can come from an improvement in your energy levels. It starts with monitoring your environment, your daily activities, and internal factors.

By noticing your energy under certain circumstances, you can come to conclusive ideas.

### This can give us the edge we need to push forth.
