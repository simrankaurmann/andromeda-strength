A to Z, the in's and outs of modelling technique

Modeling is a form of observational learning where an athlete observes another individual around the same level of skill learning perform sport related movements and receive feedback.[57] This has been shown help modify athletes' thoughts, emotions, and behaviors in beneficial ways. In order for this form of learning to work the athlete must be motivated, attentive, able to recall, and willing to try to mimic their observation of the model.[57]

The above is one reason why itâ€™s beneficial for athletes that want to advance to the next level in their training to attend different gyms. This can be accomplished via frequently seeking out new gyms where you find regulars that are more experienced than you. Sticking to 1 gym is not necessarily the best thing you can do. Diversify. You are the average of people you spend the most time with. So spend it with who you want to become.

Once you start frequenting gyms where you have a lot to learn from people you will begin taking on their form, energy, focus, drive and receive feedback and apply it to your own work outs. To take this idea forward, you can also engage them to try do a set with them, especially if they are working out alone. This gives you a closeness to the ideal technique you are trying to mimic or at least learn elements from. This can also give you a chance to ask questions. Generaly what I have noticed is that people will help you with tips and ideas themselves, especially in relation to your form, as they have just witnessed it. But of course you can also keep to yourself and still benefit from effects of modelling. Good thing we are social beings and we watch other people subconsciously.

Certain extent of this behaviour, you will do involuntarily. Monkey see, monkey do. It only does good for your cause to actively observe other gym goers. This is not to say that you stare at them! Do not worry too much about who you observe, at first try to observe as many people as possible. Then slowly start narrowing down. I have found that everyone has their own unique technique which differs from another in many myriads of ways, you can develop this keenness of attention too.

The easiest way to make this strategy work for you is to try observing those who have the physical results you desire i.e. an impressive physique or someone who lifts an impressive amount of weight.

Tip: have multiple people you admire in the gym and observe their form regularly and actively apply it to your own workouts.

Results from this may start slowly, over time you need to find more gyms which can satisfy your needs for observation of even higher level athletes which can benefit from.
