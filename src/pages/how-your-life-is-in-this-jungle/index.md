spoiler: Do I live in the jungle? 
---

We live in the jungle. There we are, roaming around, huddling with your crew, feeding on the shrubs. Some birds sitting on the trees.

You in majesty. This is your life in your jungle, the way you live and exist. Do the best you can with what you have. It’s your life how you choose to live. I want you to know that you have perfect control on how you conduct yourself. That little range of motion to drink water. Or that grand strategy that spans 10 years of your life. It could all be under your masterful control.

You are this elaborate creature gazing over the edge of the mountain, obersving the minute detail in the elephants and butterflies but also equally observing the vast savannah in front of you. You’re eyes are focused and sharp and you can see the universe itself reflecting back at you. How do you choose to conduct yourself now?

Even for the most skilled the success is never guaranteed. This offers us great opportunity. Because it means people like us who are not very skilled have a chance to compete and get something. There is a chance because nothing is guaranteed. This is the universe giving you opportunity to have something. Although it won’t hand it to you for free, it doesn’t set a price either. You cannot find out the price before you pay it. Only in retrospect will you realise what you have paid. Find the answer that’s what the universe wants, for whatever reason, we are subject to this. What better than to surrender to this force and get involved in the jungle? None.

There is no reason to feel hopeless because there is always opportunity around. If you just missed the opportunity there will be more. That is the nature of the world in constant change. You miss one, dont dwell on it. There’s more around that u may lose if you don’t focus on them.

When you walk into the gym like you walk in your jungle, know you have one mission. When you drank water in the jungle you did not remember your wife cheated on you. You did not remember that you’re a low life scum. You’re attention is focused on the action ahead, life that weight of righteousness. Even if you drenching in falsehood this is the one place that can be your temple of righteousness. The real you. The you that’s a saviour to the world. This is your opportunity to satisfy your deepest need.

Give your self up to the mission at hand. Give up everything cuz now everything is in his hands, with the weight in your hands. Will you play your part whilst he is playing his? The thing is in front of you. Will you lift it or will you do something else? The time is ripe as it has ever been, for that man that drank that water from the river beds 100,000 years ago, or that mother who beared that child at 14. Was their time wrong? If it wasn’t then nor is your time wrong to lift this weight. Lift it now.

You don’t need to think how it will happen, no one can explain how things happen. People try, and always come short. The universe is like sand you can grab some of it in your fist but not all of it. What you view in time is the information held and understood in the minds of scientists, gurus, etc. Although this can be useful it’s not exactly the truth and not exactly the universe itself. Whilst the sum in your hand continues to slip out, never coming into your view. So just surrender yourself to what you don’t know and do your part. Be his warrior. Do the job at hand. Lift that weight.

What your forefathers did before you is nothing short of miracles, they did all of what they did in order to get you where you are. And do not kid, you will not be here where you currently stand, sit and shit, if they had choose the easy way out or if they didn’t have the perseverance with something. Then look at yourself here, have you done anything anywhere near as close to them yet? How are you going to spit in their face by giving this little piece of weight in front of you victory over you?

Nobody is mentioning anything to do with the pace of how quickly you move, but movement is important, betterment is important. Not for you, for the rest that come after you. They may not remember your name or what you did. But

We are so detached from our Physical existence and our connection to all things in the world. This has cut us off so much strength. I am not aying you go off into the wild to rrestore your connecvtion with the world and in turn redeem your strength. Just knowing the truth can inspire you for change.

Let’s look at how did good and bad come about. It’s via learned behaviour and action. Nobody knew for sure what they were doing was good or bad. We pick up on the results of our action as cues.

Eventually we became better at projecting the causes of our actions far into the future. This led us to develop our set of morals and ideas.
